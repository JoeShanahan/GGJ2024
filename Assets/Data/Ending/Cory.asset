  EndingText:
  - Cory Donnely is arrested for the murder of Cory Donnely. Nobody is quite sure
    what to charge him with, but since the body looked exactly like him, the police
    figured it must have something to do with him, and they were just happy to have
    the case closed.
  - "When you read in the news a few weeks later that Cory mysteriously disappeared
    from prison, you can\u2019t help but think there was maybe more to that man than
    you\u2019d originally seen."
