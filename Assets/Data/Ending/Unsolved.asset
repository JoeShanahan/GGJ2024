  - "You feel like you almost had it, but the pieces of the puzzle just weren\u2019t
    coming together. Maybe this was too ambitious for you? Maybe you tried to solve
    too much in too short a time? "
  - "You tell yourself if you had just another few hours it would\u2019ve all made
    sense, but you\u2019ll have to wait until next time to find out if you\u2019re
    right."
