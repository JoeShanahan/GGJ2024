  EndingText:
  - As Judith is taken away in handcuffs, you wonder to yourself the real reason
    you accused her. Did she actually have anything to do with it? Or did you see
    something in her that made you uncomfortable? A reflection of yourself?
  - "The world isn\u2019t ready for more than one of you. The police seem happy to
    close the case no matter how thin the evidence is, you won\u2019t have to confront
    your demons this time.\r"
  - ' But was this really how the story was supposed to end?'
