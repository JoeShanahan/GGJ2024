  - Everyone finds the conclusion to the case a bit anticlimactic, but capitalism
    is the obvious culprit. They all agree to purchase reusable items from now on,
    and stop feeding the never satisfied beast that controls their lives
  - "But they know it\u2019s only a matter of  days before they give in, after all,
    they like the convenience of it. Even if it will kill them all eventually.\r"
