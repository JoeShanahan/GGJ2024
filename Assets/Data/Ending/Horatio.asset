  - Horatio attempts to stop you from leaving, he puts his hand firmly on your shoulder.
    That was a mistake.
  - "You grab him by the wrist and throw him to the floor. It\u2019s satisfying to
    see him on the floor, confused and upset, but you feel the need to have the final
    word before you walk away."
