  - The mass of bones behind you start to stir, and then stretch out as if waking
    from a very long slumber. The newly formed creature turns towards the group of
    people who had kept it captive for so long, and put it on display as a novelty.
  - "You hear a booming noise, from all around you. \u201CNow it\u2019s time for
    <i>your</i> corpses to be put on display for all eternity\u201D"
